# Study Notes from Certified Kubernetes Administrator journey

These are not complete documents and instructions for how to complete
a particular task.  Think of it as a set of notes, bookmarks, and other
"scribbling" to help me remember how to complete the task.  Perhaps
I'll clean them up when I recertify in a couple years.
