# Output from kubeadm commands

## Control Plane Node 1

The output looks something like this (just kubeadm output):

```bash

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token hu12vl.kwq46xao4y5rtixp \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:41e97620abf3f5bd1e9f69c619e8120609dab80af01e56c6b1813c9d39d7e946 \
    --control-plane --certificate-key 92243a52ce0806fe8aac529bef5df45eebf2a4ad2a3510e28dccdce278e43779

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token hu12vl.kwq46xao4y5rtixp --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:41e97620abf3f5bd1e9f69c619e8120609dab80af01e56c6b1813c9d39d7e946

This node has joined the cluster and a new control plane instance was created:

* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and approval was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.
* Control plane (master) label and taint were applied to the new node.
* The Kubernetes control plane instances scaled up.
* A new etcd member was added to the local/stacked etcd cluster.

To start administering your cluster from this node, you need to run the following as a regular user:

        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Run 'kubectl get nodes' to see this node join the cluster.
